    "chunk_text": "Edit text in a PDF \nOpen the PDF you want to edit in Acrobat, and then select Edit in the global bar. The PDF switches to the edit mode, and the Edit panel displays. If the PDF is generated from a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR to make the text and images editable. The Edit panel includes options to modify the page, add content, redact a PDF, and convert various documents to PDF forms. You can use the options in the Edit panel to replace, edit, or add text to a PDF. You can correct typos, change fonts and typeface size, adjust alignment, add superscripts or subscripts, and resize text or paragraphs. Set the default font for adding and editing text When you add text in a PDF, by default Acrobat chooses nearby font attributes for the new text. When you edit text, any font that isn't available on the system is substituted by a default fall-back font for the particular script. For example, Minion Pro is the default fall-back font for Roman script fonts. The substitution of unavailable fonts by default fonts can introduce inconsistency in the look and feel of text in a PDF document. To avoid inconsistency, choose a specific font for any text that is added or modified in the PDF document from Font Options under Content Editing. 1.  From the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS), choose Preferences. The Preferences dialog box is displayed. (Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+K keys on Windows® or Command+K keys on macOS.) 2.  In the dialog box, select Content Editing under Categories to display Font Options. 3.  Select an appropriate font in the drop-down lists: 1.  Fallback font for Editing. 2.  Default font for Add Text and Font Size. 4.  Select OK to save the changes and close the Preferences dialog box. Change, replace, or delete text When you edit text, the text in the paragraph reflows within its text box to accommodate the changes.
