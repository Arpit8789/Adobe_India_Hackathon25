    "chunk_text": "What’s the best way to create a PDF? PDF creation methods by file type You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® \nfiles, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF \nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the \nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. \nIf you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method. Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the diﬀerent types of files. File Type PDF Creation Methods Any file format Method 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a \nfile type and then select the file that you want to convert to \nPDF. Or, select the hamburger menu \nthe File menu (macOS)  > Create and then select the \nappropriate file type and follow through the steps. (Windows) or Method 2: Drag and drop a file from your system to the \nAcrobat Home page. Method 3: Right-click on the file and then select Convert to \nAdobe PDF.
