A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and \nreduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party \ntimestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a \ntimestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature \nProperties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the \nlocal time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one \nlater to your signature. (See Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied \nafter signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can \nobtain from an administrator or a security settings file. If you have a security settings file, install it and don’t use the following instructions for \nconfiguring a server. Ensure that you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source. \nDon’t install it without checking with your system administration or IT department. 1.
