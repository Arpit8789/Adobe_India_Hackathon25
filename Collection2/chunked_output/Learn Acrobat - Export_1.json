Saving a PDF in text format allows you to use the content with a screen reader, screen \nmagnifier, or other assistive technology. If you don’t have access to the source files that created an Adobe PDF, you can still copy \nimages and text from the PDF to use elsewhere. You can also export the PDF to a reusable \nformat, or export images in a PDF to another format. Adobe Acrobat Reader users can save a copy of a PDF or PDF Portfolio if the creator of the \ndocument has enabled usage rights. If a document has additional or restricted usage rights, \nthe document message bar under the toolbar area describes the assigned restrictions or \nprivileges. Use this method to save PDFs, including PDF Portfolios, and PDFs in which you have added \ncomments, form field entries, and digital signatures.

The original \nfile is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the \nchanges you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new \ninformation that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the \nautosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes \nof your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is \nespecially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you \nclose, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave \nfeature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded.
