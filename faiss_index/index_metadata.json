    "chunk_text": "What’s the best way to create a PDF? PDF creation methods by file type You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® \nfiles, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF \nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the \nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. \nIf you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method. Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the diﬀerent types of files. File Type PDF Creation Methods Any file format Method 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a \nfile type and then select the file that you want to convert to \nPDF. Or, select the hamburger menu \nthe File menu (macOS)  > Create and then select the \nappropriate file type and follow through the steps. (Windows) or Method 2: Drag and drop a file from your system to the \nAcrobat Home page. Method 3: Right-click on the file and then select Convert to \nAdobe PDF. Paper documents \n(Requires a scanner) Microsoft Oﬃce \ndocuments Method 4: Open the file in its source application and go \nto Print > Adobe PDF printer. Method 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, \nselect Scanner as the file type, select the scanner, and follow \nthrough the steps or browse to locate a pre-scanned page."

If the PDF is generated from a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR to make the text and images editable. The Edit panel includes options to modify the page, add content, redact a PDF, and convert various documents to PDF forms. You can use the options in the Edit panel to replace, edit, or add text to a PDF. You can correct typos, change fonts and typeface size, adjust alignment, add superscripts or subscripts, and resize text or paragraphs. Set the default font for adding and editing text When you add text in a PDF, by default Acrobat chooses nearby font attributes for the new text. When you edit text, any font that isn't available on the system is substituted by a default fall-back font for the particular script. For example, Minion Pro is the default fall-back font for Roman script fonts. The substitution of unavailable fonts by default fonts can introduce inconsistency in the look and feel of text in a PDF document. To avoid inconsistency, choose a specific font for any text that is added or modified in the PDF document from Font Options under Content Editing. 1.  From the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS), choose Preferences. The Preferences dialog box is displayed. (Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+K keys on Windows® or Command+K keys on macOS.) 2.  In the dialog box, select Content Editing under Categories to display Font Options. 3.  Select an appropriate font in the drop-down lists: 1.  Fallback font for Editing. 2.  Default font for Add Text and Font Size. 4.  Select OK to save the changes and close the Preferences dialog box.

    "chunk_text": "Editing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non-\neditable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility \nissues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from \nscanned images. To streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing \na scanned document: Check the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output. When you open a \nscanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the \ndocument editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is \naccurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize \nText tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance \nscanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before \nattempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and \nformatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't \nhave the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, \nremove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove \nsecurity from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF. Avoid editing complex elements. If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, \navoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. Check for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is \ncompatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe \nAcrobat. For more information, see System requirements. Save a backup copy. Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making \nany edits. Revert to the original document if any issues arise during the editing process."

Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to \ncontrol access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server \naccess to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document \nrecipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients \nfrom LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, \nediting, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate \ndocuments, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign \ndocuments quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the \nsigner and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, \nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the \nauthenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are \ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader settings.

To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation \nmust be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the \ndocument signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a \nlimited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. \nWhen a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing \nrevocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable.
